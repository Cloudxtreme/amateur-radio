# My Amateur Radio Experience

I recently got a [Baofeng BF-F8HP](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00MAULSOK/).  Its my first ham radio and it is serving me very well. I also got the [Nagoya NA-771 Antenna](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00KC4PWQQ/), and this [programming cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00HUB0ONK/). [The ARRL Ham Radio License Manual](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1625950136/) is the book I bought to study.

I am using [CHIRP](http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) to program my BF-F8HP.

I am new to ham radio and I would like to get my license because I am interested in using radios. I think getting my license would be very practical.
